# simpleCrypter
A simple text cipher which uses [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

#### Required:
* Python 3 :)
* easyGUI module for python


###### This project was previously on my private repository on BitBucket, I moved it to GitHub.
###### Version 1.0 was very basic, only commandline, I was learning python when I created this program.
###### Now when it is being moved to GitHub it is improved a bit.

#### Changelog for v2.0
* GUI added using easyGUI

###### At the time I added GUI I was not familiar with Tkinter. But now I am, hence I will be updating this code to use Tkinter.

## I love Python.. :)
